  abstract  = {We consider the non-linear spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation, and develop a polar spectral discretization in two dimensions based on Laguerre polynomials, which generalizes previous methods by Ender and Ender [A.Ya.~Ender and I.A.~Ender: Polynomial expansions for the isotropic Boltzmann equation and invariance of the collision integral with respect to the choice of basis functions. Physics of Fluids, 11:2720--2730, 1999] to the case of non-radially symmetric solutions. The method yields sparse approximation for long times and enjoys exponential convergence in the number of degrees of freedom for analytic solutions. A particular implementation exactly conserves mass, momentum and energy. Compared to the Fourier spectral discretization method, we need not truncate the collision operator and, thus, avoid aliasing errors.},

  year      = {2017},
  abstract  = {Deep neural networks are surprisingly efficient at solving practical tasks, but the theory behind this phenomenon is only starting to catch up with the practice. Numerous works show that depth is the key to this efficiency. A certain class of deep convolutional networks -- namely those that correspond to the Hierarchical Tucker (HT) tensor decomposition -- has been proven to have exponentially higher expressive power than shallow networks. I.e. a shallow network of exponential width is required to realize the same score function as computed by the deep architecture. In this paper, we prove the expressive power theorem (an exponential lower bound on the width of the equivalent shallow network) for a class of recurrent neural networks -- ones that correspond to the Tensor Train (TT) decomposition. This means that even processing an image patch by patch with an RNN can be exponentially more efficient than a (shallow) convolutional network with one hidden layer. Using theoretical results on the relation between the tensor decompositions we compare expressive powers of the HT- and TT-Networks. We also implement the recurrent TT-Networks and provide numerical evidence of their expressivity.},

  abstract  = {Vortex shedding around circular cylinders is a well known and studied phenomenon that appears in many engineering fields. In this work a Reduced Order Model (ROM) of the incompressible flow around a circular cylinder, built performing a Galerkin projection of the governing equations onto a lower dimensional space is presented. The reduced basis space is generated using a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) approach. In particular the focus is into (i) the correct reproduction of the pressure field, that in case of the vortex shedding phenomenon, is of primary importance for the calculation of the drag and lift coefficients; (ii) for this purpose the projection of the Governing equations (momentum equation and Poisson equation for pressure) is performed onto different reduced basis space for velocity and pressure, respectively; (iii) all the relevant modifications necessary to adapt standard finite element POD-Galerkin methods to a finite volume framework are presented. The accuracy of the reduced order model is assessed against full order results.},

  title     = {Parametric solutions of turbulent incompressible flows in {OpenFOAM} via the proper generalised decomposition},
  year      = {2020},
  abstract  = {An a priori reduced order method based on the proper generalised decomposition (PGD) is proposed to compute parametric solutions involving turbulent incompressible flows of interest in an industrial context, using OpenFOAM. The PGD framework is applied for the first time to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the turbulent regime, to compute a generalised solution for velocity, pressure and turbulent viscosity, explicitly depending on the design parameters of the problem. In order to simulate flows of industrial interest, a minimally intrusive implementation based on OpenFOAM SIMPLE algorithm applied to the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model is devised. The resulting PGD strategy is applied to parametric flow control problems and achieves both qualitative and quantitative agreement with the full order OpenFOAM solution for convection-dominated fully-developed turbulent incompressible flows, with Reynolds number up to one million.},
